A web server for Ig-Seq Analysis Pipeline

<p align="justify">
ASAP facilitates bioinformatics analyses on NGS antibody V gene data. One of the strengths of ASAP is that it allows analyzing experimental replicates, which is valuable for increasing the signal to noise ratio. Another major component is to upload the NGS data as obtained from the sequencing machine without any need for preprocessing. ASAP is freely available and is applicable for researchers that are interested to address basic questions related to B cell development and differentiation as well as applied researchers. For further details please refer to https://ASAP.tau.ac.il/overview.html. For an example dataset/run see https://ASAP.tau.ac.il/gallery.html.
